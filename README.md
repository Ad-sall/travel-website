## Description 

This project is a review of a creative brief and I code a webpage using Bootstrap 4, HTML, and CSS.

 A creative briefâ€™s help me guide my design decisions for exemple when I receive a design from a product manager or client.

I use redlined wireframes to better understand the layout handed off to me, so I have a visual idea of how I want to go about coding up the page. When I see a design as a series of boxes, it helps me digest a task that can sometimes feel overwhelming at first glance.
